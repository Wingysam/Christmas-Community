## Amazon Smile
By default, Christmas Community converts www.amazon.com links to smile.amazon.com. If you do not want this, set the environment variable SMILE to false (if you are using Docker Compose, make sure to put "false" in quotes).

## Root Path
If you want put Christmas Community on a subdirectory, such as `/christmas-community`, set `ROOT_PATH` to that path.

## Docker
```
docker run --detach --name christmas-community -p 80:80 --restart always wingysam/christmas-community
```

## Docker Compose
```yml
---
version: "3"
services:
  christmas-community:
    image: wingysam/christmas-community
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    ports:
      # If you want to go to localhost:8080 to access Christmas Community,
      # use - 8080:80 instead of
      - 80:80
    environment:
      # Amazon Smile, set to 'false' to disable www.amazon.com links
      # turning into smile.amazon.com
      SMILE: 'true'
      # Table mode, set to 'false' to revert to box mode
      TABLE: 'true'
      # Single list mode
      # (for weddings, birthdays, etc. only the admin account's list is accessible)
      # Set to 'true' to enable
      SINGLE_LIST: 'false'
      # Some websites (like walmart) send headers that are larger than 8MB in
      # length. If issues are encountered, set the node.js limit to a higher
      # number than 8192
      #NODE_OPTIONS: "--max-http-header-size=32768"
